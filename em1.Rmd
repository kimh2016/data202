## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
1.
a)
car_prices %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = mileage, y = price / 1000, color = type, shape = type)) + 
   geom_point() +
   scale_x_continuous(label = comma) +
   labs( x = "Mileage (mi)",
   y = "Price ($1000)")

b)
car_prices %>% mutate(median = case_when(mileage < median(mileage) ~ "Low mileage", 
mileage > median(mileage) ~ "High mileage"))  %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = price / 1000, y = fct_reorder(type, price), color = median)) + geom_boxplot() +
labs(x = "Price ($1000)", y = " ", color = " ")



2. 
a)
car_prices  %>% group_by(make)  %>% summarize(count = n())  %>% arrange(desc(count))  %>% 
knitr::kable() 

b)
car_prices %>% filter(doors == 4)  %>%  group_by(type)  %>% 
summarize(average_price = median(price))  %>% arrange(desc(average_price))  %>% 
knitr::kable() 

3.
a)


b)
# How many rows didn't match?
car_prices_and_eco <- car_prices  %>% 
   mutate(models = str_to_upper(model)) 
car_prices_and_eco %>% 
   left_join(fuel_eco_avg, by = c("models" = "carline_name"))

c)
car_prices_and_eco_longer <- car_prices_and_eco  %>% 
pivot_longer(cols = c(city, highway, combined), names_to ="Measure" , values_to = "value") 

car_prices_and_eco_longer %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = value, y = price / 1000, color = Measure)) +
ylim(10,47) +
geom_smooth() + 
geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```
